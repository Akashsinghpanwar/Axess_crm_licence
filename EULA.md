## 1. License Grant
Subject to your compliance with this EULA and timely payment of any applicable fees, Axess grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access and use the Service for your internal business purposes during the applicable subscription term.

## 2. Restrictions
You shall not (and shall not permit any third party to):
- copy, modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of the Service;
- reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law);
- rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, or otherwise transfer the Service to any third party;
- use the Service to develop a competing product or service or for benchmarking without our written consent;
- access the Service in any manner that violates applicable law, infringes third-party rights, or circumvents security or usage limits.

## 3. Accounts & Credentials
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.

## 4. Third-Party Services (e.g., QuickBooks Online)
The Service may interoperate with third-party services such as Intuit QuickBooks Online, Supabase, cloud hosting, analytics, or email providers (collectively, “Third-Party Services”). Your use of Third-Party Services is governed by their terms. We are not responsible for Third-Party Services or their availability. You authorize us to exchange data with Third-Party Services as reasonably necessary to provide the Service.

## 5. Customer Data & Ownership
“**Customer Data**” means any data, content, or materials you (or on your behalf) submit to the Service, including accounting/CRM records (e.g., quotes, invoices, purchase orders), and personal data. As between the parties, you retain all rights in Customer Data. You grant Axess a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, process, transmit, display, and back up Customer Data as necessary to provide and support the Service and to improve security, reliability, and performance.

## 6. Usage Data
We may generate and use aggregated and/or de-identified data derived from the operation of the Service (“Usage Data”) for analytics, benchmarking, service improvement, and business purposes, provided it does not identify you or any natural person.

## 7. Service Levels & Changes
We may modify the Service, features, or components from time to time. If a change materially reduces core functionality you rely on, you may terminate for convenience (Section 11) and receive a pro-rated refund of prepaid, unused fees.

## 8. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the Service and Customer Data (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, auditing). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 9. Fees & Taxes
Fees (if applicable) are set out in the ordering document or plan page. Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable except as expressly stated herein. You are responsible for all applicable taxes, excluding taxes based on our net income.

## 10. Confidentiality
Each party may access confidential information of the other. The receiving party will protect such information with at least the same care it uses to protect its own confidential information and not less than reasonable care. Exclusions apply for information that is public, independently developed, or rightfully obtained from a third party.

## 11. Term and Termination
This EULA remains in effect for the subscription term unless terminated:
- by either party for material breach not cured within 30 days’ written notice; or
- by you for convenience (any time) — in which case fees already paid are non-refundable, except as stated in Section 7.

Upon termination, your license ends and you must cease use of the Service. We will, upon written request within 30 days after termination, make available for export the Customer Data we still host, unless prohibited by law.

## 12. Warranties & Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, AXESS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. AXESS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL AXESS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, DATA, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY.  
AXESS’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS EULA SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, the limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.

## 14. Compliance & Export
You will use the Service in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (including anti-bribery, sanctions, and export control laws). You represent that you are not located in, under control of, or a national/resident of any prohibited country or on any denied party list.

## 15. Governing Law; Disputes
This EULA and any dispute shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Scotland**, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The courts of **Scotland** shall have exclusive jurisdiction, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue there.

## 16. Updates to this EULA
We may update this EULA from time to time. We will post updates at this URL and update the “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.
